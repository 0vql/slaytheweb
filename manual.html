				Slay the Web is a single player card game where you fight monsters to reach the end
				of the web. It's a game of planning and knowing when to play which card.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every turn you draw 5 cards from your draw pile. Cards cost energy to play, and you
				get 3 energy every turn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cards may deal damage to monsters, block enemy attacks or make them weak or
				vulnerable. They can heal you and other things. You'll figure it out.
			</p>
			<p>Beware, whenever you end your turn, the monsters take turn.</p>
			<p>
				Should you manage to kill the monsters in a room before they end you, you'll proceed
				to the next room. Maybe there will be rewards. Can you reach the end?
			</p>
			<p>
			The game concept follows the original Slay the Spire, but it doesn't have to.</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://github.com/oskarrough/slaytheweb" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">game is open source</a>. It'd be wonderful with more contributors.
