# Kortgame

Many ways to go. This is the first.

We need

- A deck of cards
- Cards have different cost and actions
- An action could be draw a card, deal damage, everything is an action
- All actions are queued

Let's figure out how to draw a deck, play it console-style no ui.

 	CHAR_SELECT, GAMEPLAY, DUNGEON_TRANSITION, SPLASH;
}
