# Slay the Web

This is a browser-based card game and engine based on Slay The Spire, a fantastic video game designed by [MegaCrit](https://www.megacrit.com/):

> We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could. Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures, discover relics of immense power, and Slay the Spire!

After many runs in the Spire, I really got into the theory behind the game. Inspired by the STS modding community, I thought it'd be neat and a great learning experience to try and implement the core logic of the game in JavaScript for the web. And that is what _Slay the Web_ is: a kind of stable, UI agnostic game engine and an example UI for the web.

## Documentation

If you're interested in contributing to the game or merely curious how it works, see [the documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

TLDR; Clone the repository and open the `public` folder in a web browser. The code is written in a way so no compiling is necessary. The `public/game` folder contains the actual game logic and the `public/ui` folder is the website UI where you can actually play the game. To ease development, you can run `npm install; npm start` to get a live-reloading server, although this is not required.

## How to deploy it

The `main` branch automatically deploys to https://slaytheweb.cards, via the Vercel service, every time it is pushed to.  
If you open a PR, it'll give you a preview URL as well for testing.
